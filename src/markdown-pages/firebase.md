## What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps. **Build anything you can imagine** with over 2000 plugins and **performance, scalability**, and **security** built-in by default.

Gatsby loads only **critical** parts of the page, so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby **prefetches** resources for other pages so that clicking on the site feels incredibly fast. Gatsby lets teams focus on creating content-driven websites instead of worrying about performance.

More than just a static site generator, Gatsby has all the tools for building the modern web: Plugins for seamlessly integrating services, Themes for effortless configuration, and Recipes for automating common site building chores.

## Not just static React

Using Gatsby plugins, React components are generated using Markdown files before the site is built, allowing Gatsby to act as a headless CMS.
