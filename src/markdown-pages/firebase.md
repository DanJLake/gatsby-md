## This site is hosted using Firebase

Firebase is a Google platform for Web Application hosting and management. It gives you functionality like analytics, databases, messaging and crash reporting and supports web and mobile applications.

Firebase can provide an entire backend for applications, giving users a quick, intuitive sign-in process with Firebase Authentication and allow users to sign in to your app with their Facebook, Twitter, Google, or GitHub account with less than 5 minutes of work.

With built in databases and easy access to Google's other web services you can easily implement analytics, ads, chat, payments and more.

Gatsby builds can be easily deployed to Firebase using the firebase and gatsby CLIs.
